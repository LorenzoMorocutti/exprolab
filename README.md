# Repository for the Experimental Robotrics Laboratory Course od the University of Genoa
This repository is structured as follows:
* *Assignment 1*: branch for the first assignment. In this assignment is requested to create a finite state machine that simulates the game *Cluedo*;
* *Assignment 2*: branch for the second assignment. In this assignment is requested to apply the logic of the state machine of the first assignment on a robot that has to move to different locations to collect hints. It is also needed to use `Moveit` in order to move the mechanil arm of the robot;
* *Assignment 3*: branch for the third assignment. In this assignment there is an even more complete and complex situation: the robot has to search for hints in a difficult environment (there are walls and rooms) full of markers (so it needs a camera). The logic of the first assignment remains valid neverthless.
